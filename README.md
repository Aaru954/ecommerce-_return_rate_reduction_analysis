 E-commerce Return Analysis Project
 (made by arya dalvi)

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze product return behavior in an e-commerce business using data science techniques. It identifies return trends, predicts high-risk products, and presents interactive dashboards to help reduce return rates and optimize decision-making.



🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Data cleaning, analysis, modeling
- Pandas: Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn: Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression)
- Power BI: Visualization and dashboard creation
- VS Code: Development environment



📂 Datasets
1. `orders.csv`: Contains order details (order_id, product_id, order_date, category, supplier, price, region, marketing_channel)
2. `returns.csv`: Contains return details (order_id, product_id, return_date)


✅ Key Steps

1. Data Preparation
- Loaded orders and returns CSVs
- Removed nulls and duplicates
- Fixed date formats (`order_date`, `return_date`)
- Merged datasets on `order_id`
- Created `is_returned` flag (1 = returned, 0 = not)

2. Return Rate Analysis
- Grouped by:
  - Category
  - Supplier
  - Region
  - Marketing Channel
- Calculated return percentages

3. Predictive Modeling
- Built a Logistic Regression model
- Features: `price`, `category`, `supplier`
- Created a new column: `return_probability`
- Identified high-risk products (`probability > 0.5`)

 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Bar Charts: Return rate by category/supplier
- Line Chart: Monthly return trends
- Table: High-risk product list
- Slicers: Category, Region, Supplier
- Drill-through page for category-level insights



📊 Outputs
- `merged_orders_returns.csv`: Cleaned & merged dataset with return flags
- `high_risk_products.csv`: Products with return probability > 0.5
- Power BI interactive dashboard
- Final report: [`Ecommerce_Return_Analysis_Report.pdf`]


🚀 Future Enhancements
- Use Random Forest or XGBoost for improved predictions
- Add customer-level behavior and feedback data
- Deploy dashboard via Power BI Service for team access

📌 Conclusion
This project offers actionable insights into customer return behavior. The interactive Power BI dashboard allows users to explore trends, identify problematic segments, and use predictive analytics to anticipate future returns.
